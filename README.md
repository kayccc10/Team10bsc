Binance smart chain project ~ Identity request and verification

What is Tendity?

This is a Decentralized Application that gives users the option of only sharing their personal information with organizations they know and trust. This gives the users the power of their data and they can choose which applications have access to what information. Picture a reality where you can create multiple accounts;PayPal, Binance, Credit Account, ThatAccount.com etc which need user personal details to function only without the gist of filling in your details and having to upload personal documents everytime.

Tendity aims to expedite the process by creating an ecosystem where clients can easily place their verified identity cards on the blockchain, relieving institutions of the verification process during registration thereby speeding up the registration. It is the application for your virtual identity. WE help you create a profile that you can use numerously, only through singular uploads of your particulars.
