What is Tendity?

This is a Decentralized Application that gives users the option of only sharing their personal information with organizations they know and trust. This gives the users the power of their data and they can choose which applicatins have access to what information.

Tendity aims to expedite the process by creating an ecosystem where clients can easily place their verified identity cards on the blockchain, relieving institutions of the verification process during registration thereby speeding up the registration.
