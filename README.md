# Tendity
Binance smart chain project ~ Identity request and verification

What is Tendity?

Tendity is a Decentralized Application that aims to bridge the gap between clients and institutions. Traditionally, the biggest issue users face when trying to connect to a certain institution is the registration process. The whole process of ID request from the institution to verification takes a while. 

Tendity aims to expedite the process by creating an ecosystem where clients can easily place their verified identity cards on the blockchain, relieving institutions of the verification process during registration thereby speeding up the registration.
