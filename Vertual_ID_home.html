                Picture a reality were you can create multiple accounts [PayPal, Binance, Credit Account, ThatAccount.com], "significantly accounts which need user-personal-details to function" only without the gist of -</br>
                Filling-in your details and having to upload personal documentation EVERY TIME.</p>
            
            <p>

                Tendity is the application for your Virtual Identity.</br> We help you create a profile you can use numerously, only through singular uploads of your particulars. This is made safe through blockchain  technology, meaning your data isn't stored in some computer-server, so no risk of your data being used for third parties, and only YOU have the power to decide what happens(who gets access to your data).
                More so - if you decide to let an institution in to your account, you can also manage the amount of information they have access too, so you're in control. </p>
